# 专业英语冲刺班 Biological English Oral Translation (May 2024 - Present)

## Overview

This tutoring course is designed for students who are preparing for the English translation section in PhD application interviews of Biology/Life Sciences programs. The course is tailored to the needs of each student, focusing on the areas where they need the most improvement, after a [mock interview session](/assets/download_files/After_mock_interview_WJY.pdf). The interview usually examines aapplicants' pronunciation, vocabulary, translation, and comprehension skills. The course will cover the following topics:

1. **Pronunciation**: Practice the pronunciation of common biological terms and phrases in class.

2. **Vocabulary**: Learn and memorize the vocabulary commonly used in biology and life sciences (in the form of posting records to group chat from vocabulary apps).

3. **Translation**: Practice translating biological texts from English to Chinese fluently.

4. **Comprehension**: Grasping basic aims and findings of the text (i.e., abstracts from latest publications) given.

## Schedule

### First Class (May 26):

[Four full abstracts](/assets/download_files/L1.pdf) will be sent to everyone in advance. Students should practice and prepare the abstract before the class. During the class, we will read and translate the abstract sentence by sentence. I will note areas for significant improvement for each participant.

[Translation](/assets/download_files/L1_CN.pdf) of the four abstracts will be provided after the class.

### Second Class (June 2):

[Vocabulary](/assets/download_files/L2-Glossary.pdf) will be sent to everyone in advance. Students should familiarize themselves with the pronunciation and meaning of these words before the class. During the class, we will read and translate the abstract, focusing on improving fluency now that vocabulary hurdles have been addressed.

[Full text](/assets/download_files/L2.pdf), [slides](/assets/download_files/L2ppt.pdf) and [translation](/assets/download_files/L2-CN.pdf) of the four abstracts will be provided after the class.

### Third Class (June 16, no class on June 9 due to Dragon Boat Festival):

No pre-class materials will be provided. The class will involve live practice. At the end, I will summarize common prefixes and suffixes to help students guess unfamiliar words. Full text and translation will be provided after the class.
