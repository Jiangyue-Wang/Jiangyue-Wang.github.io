# About me

I’m Jiangyue Wang (王江月 in Chinese, pronounced __Jyang-yweh Wong__), a graduate student in the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM) program at the University of Washington. My research focuses on the ecology and conservation of large carnivores, with particular interests in movement modeling using Bayesian frameworks, conservation planning, and eDNA techniques. I’ve worked with leopards, snow leopards, and mountain lions.

If you share similar interests or would like to connect and chat, I’d love to hear from you!

# Current research projects

**Cougars on the Olympic Peninsula**: Mortality risks, dispersing behavior, and interactions with snow.
